Hello! I am a passionate second year student currently immersing myself in the world of technology and pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering. 
My primary focus lies in the dynamic areas of web development and Android application development, where I hone my skills to create innovative and user-centric solutions. 
In addition to my academic pursuits, I have immersed myself in the vast domain of cloud computing through various Google Cloud courses and have accumulated more than 9 certifications that underline my commitment to remain at the forefront of cutting edge technology. 
My journey also includes a stimulating virtual internship accredited by AICTE where I immersed myself in the fascinating realms of artificial intelligence, machine learning and cyber security.
These experiences not only broadened my technical knowledge, but also instilled in me a deep passion for pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. 
I look forward to more challenges and opportunities to contribute to the ever-evolving technology landscape.

Thank you
ADNAAN AHMAD
